# Initial Prompt for Claude 3.7
"Hello Claude. Based on the detailed product requirements document provided above, please generate the initial project structure for a Next.js application called 'Nexus Drafter'.

Please provide the code for the following key parts:

The TypeScript type definitions for Player, Game, Table, and SessionState.
A basic state management setup using zustand that initializes a sample SessionState.
The main page component (app/page.tsx) that lays out the three main UI areas: AvailableGamesList, PlayerInfo, and TablesArea.
Scaffolding for these three components, including basic rendering of their respective data from the state store, but without the full drag-and-drop logic implemented yet."
